I'm currently an undergraduate student from Fudan University and I will go to Shanghai Center of Mathematical Sciences (SCMS) to pursue my PhD. I'm studying Algebraic Geometry and merely an amateur now. I created this website because I decided to upload some lecture notes on it and organize them.

I am not familiar with Github. So I wil keep some sub-website as templates on my website in case that I will use them later. For the moment I only update notes and (sometimes?) travelling blogs.
