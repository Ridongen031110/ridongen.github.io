The lecture was given by Daxin Xu and Zhiyu Zhang. In the lecture students quickly viewed important definitions in AG whiched I mentioned in my note. Remark: I omit the beginning of this lecture because I have learnt before the summer school. One possible reference is [Peter Scholze's Lecture Note](http://ridongen031110.github.io/ridongen.github.io/files/AGI_Lecture_Notes_Peter_SCholze.pdf)
